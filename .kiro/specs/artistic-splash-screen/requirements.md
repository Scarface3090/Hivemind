# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Hivemind splash screen implementation by incorporating an artistic, notebook-style visual design that captures the creative, playful essence of the game. Building on the current dynamic content system (contextual descriptions, adaptive headings, and smart buttons), this enhancement will replace the current background and visual elements with colorful letter blocks spelling "HIVEMIND" surrounded by scattered art supplies in a hand-drawn, artistic style that reflects the collaborative and creative nature of the guessing game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user opening the Hivemind app, I want to see the existing dynamic splash screen enhanced with an artistic notebook-style background that immediately communicates the creative and collaborative nature of the game, so that I feel excited and understand the playful brand personality while still seeing relevant game context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen loads THEN the system SHALL maintain existing dynamic content (contextual descriptions, adaptive headings, smart buttons) while displaying a new artistic background
2. WHEN the background is displayed THEN the system SHALL show colorful letter blocks spelling "HIVEMIND" integrated into a notebook/sketchbook aesthetic
3. WHEN the artistic elements appear THEN the system SHALL include scattered art supplies (pencils, erasers, paint blobs, sticky notes) around the letters
4. WHEN the background renders THEN the system SHALL use a blue-gray notebook paper aesthetic with spiral binding visible on the left side
5. WHEN displaying the composition THEN the system SHALL ensure the artistic elements don't interfere with the existing dynamic text content readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the splash screen to have smooth animations and transitions, so that the loading experience feels polished and engaging rather than static.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen appears THEN the system SHALL animate the letter blocks with subtle entrance effects
2. WHEN the splash screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL include gentle floating or breathing animations for art supplies
3. WHEN transitioning from splash screen THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth fade or slide transition to the main app
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL ensure they are performant and don't cause loading delays
5. WHEN the splash screen loads THEN the system SHALL complete all animations within 2-3 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the splash screen to look great and be fully functional across different screen sizes and orientations, so that I have a consistent brand experience regardless of how I access the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display the splash screen optimized for vertical orientation
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale the artistic elements proportionally
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the artistic composition and readability
4. WHEN displayed on high-DPI screens THEN the system SHALL render crisp, high-quality artistic elements
5. WHEN viewed on any device THEN the system SHALL ensure all text and visual elements remain legible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the artistic splash screen enhancement to integrate seamlessly with the existing buildSplashScreen function and Devvit media system, so that it enhances the current implementation without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the artistic background THEN the system SHALL replace the current bg.png asset while maintaining the existing media directory structure
2. WHEN the splash screen builds THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing dynamic content logic (buildSplashScreen function, duration-based messaging, contextual descriptions)
3. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL continue using the existing logo.png for the app icon alongside the new artistic background
4. WHEN the splash screen displays THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing Devvit post creation and media configuration
5. WHEN users interact THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing button functionality and navigation flows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the splash screen to reflect the specific visual style shown in the reference design, so that the brand identity is consistent with the intended artistic direction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying letter blocks THEN the system SHALL use bright, varied colors (red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple)
2. WHEN showing art supplies THEN the system SHALL include pencils, erasers, paint blobs, sticky notes, and other creative tools
3. WHEN rendering the background THEN the system SHALL use a blue-gray notebook paper aesthetic with spiral binding
4. WHEN displaying elements THEN the system SHALL use hand-drawn, slightly imperfect artistic styling rather than geometric precision
5. WHEN showing the composition THEN the system SHALL arrange elements in a scattered, organic layout that feels naturally creative

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the artistic background to complement rather than compete with the existing dynamic game information, so that I can easily read the game clue, spectrum labels, and call-to-action while enjoying the creative visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the artistic background is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast between background elements and overlaid text
2. WHEN dynamic content appears THEN the system SHALL position artistic elements to frame rather than obscure the game information
3. WHEN text is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain readability of clues, spectrum labels, and button text against the artistic background
4. WHEN the composition is displayed THEN the system SHALL balance the artistic "HIVEMIND" lettering with space for dynamic content
5. WHEN viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL ensure both artistic elements and text content remain legible and well-positioned
### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the artistic splash screen to come alive with engaging Phaser-powered animations that make the creative elements feel dynamic and interactive, so that the loading experience is entertaining and showcases the technical capabilities of the game platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen loads THEN the system SHALL use Phaser 3 to animate the individual "HIVEMIND" letter blocks with staggered entrance effects
2. WHEN art supplies are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement subtle floating, rotation, or breathing animations using Phaser tweens
3. WHEN the lightbulb icon appears THEN the system SHALL create a pulsing or flickering animation to simulate idea generation
4. WHEN paint blobs are shown THEN the system SHALL add gentle morphing or color-shifting animations to make them feel alive
5. WHEN pencils and erasers are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement small rotation or bobbing animations to create movement
6. WHEN the notebook spiral binding is visible THEN the system SHALL add subtle shadow or depth animations to enhance the 3D effect
7. WHEN transitioning to the main app THEN the system SHALL use Phaser scene transitions for smooth, animated handoff to the React UI
