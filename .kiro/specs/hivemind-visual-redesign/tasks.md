# Visual Redesign Implementation Plan

## Design System Usage

**ðŸ“‹ How to Use design-system.json:**

1. **Import as Reference** - All color values, typography, spacing, and component specs are defined in design-system.json
2. **Create Type-Safe Tokens** - Convert JSON values to TypeScript constants in src/shared/design-tokens.ts
3. **CSS Integration** - Import design tokens into existing CSS for consistent styling transformation
4. **Component Enhancement** - Reference design-system.json specifications for transforming existing components
5. **Particle Configuration** - Use design-system.json particles.systems for enhanced Phaser particle effects

**Example Usage with Type Safety:**

```typescript
// src/shared/design-tokens.ts
import designSystem from '../../.kiro/specs/hivemind-visual-redesign/design-system.json';

// Export with proper type safety and const assertions for literal types
export const colors = designSystem.designSystem.colors as const;
export const typography = designSystem.designSystem.typography as const;
export const particles = designSystem.designSystem.particles as const;
export const components = designSystem.designSystem.components as const;

// Type-safe component accessor with generic keyed return
export const getComponent = <K extends keyof typeof components>(
  component: K
): (typeof components)[K] => components[component];

// Alternative: Direct access for better type inference
// Usage: components.buttons.primary instead of getComponent('buttons').primary
```

## Important Implementation Guidelines

**ðŸš« CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**

1. **DO NOT change the app's name** - Keep all existing app naming and branding as "Hivemind"
2. **DO NOT run build commands or npm scripts** - All building, deployment, and testing will be handled manually by the user
3. **Code-only implementation** - Focus solely on writing/modifying code files, never execute build processes
4. **PRESERVE existing functionality** - Only modify visual styling, never change game logic or API endpoints

**ðŸ“‹ Task Execution Rules:**

- Write and modify code files only, focusing on visual enhancements
- Never run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm run deploy`, or any npm scripts
- Never execute bash commands for building or deployment
- At checkpoints, prompt user to manually build, deploy, test, and commit
- Preserve all existing game functionality while transforming visuals

**ðŸš€ Checkpoint Process:**
Each checkpoint will prompt: "Please manually run: `npm run build && npm run deploy` to test this checkpoint, then commit your changes before proceeding to the next task."
