# Implementation Plan

## Design System Usage

**ðŸ“‹ How to Use design-system.json:**
1. **Import as Reference** - All color values, typography, spacing, and component specs are defined in design-system.json
2. **Create Type-Safe Tokens** - Convert JSON values to TypeScript constants in src/shared/design-tokens.ts
3. **Tailwind Integration** - Import design tokens into tailwind.config.js for consistent styling
4. **Component Implementation** - Reference design-system.json specifications for all component styling
5. **Particle Configuration** - Use design-system.json particles.systems for all particle effect parameters

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// src/shared/design-tokens.ts
import designSystem from '../../.kiro/specs/hivemind-visual-redesign/design-system.json';

export const colors = designSystem.designSystem.colors;
export const typography = designSystem.designSystem.typography;
export const particles = designSystem.designSystem.particles;
```

## Important Implementation Guidelines

**ðŸš« CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
1. **DO NOT change the app's name** - Keep all existing app naming and branding as "Hivemind"
2. **DO NOT run build commands or npm scripts** - All building, deployment, and testing will be handled manually by the user
3. **Code-only implementation** - Focus solely on writing/modifying code files, never execute build processes

**ðŸ“‹ Task Execution Rules:**
- Write and modify code files only
- Never run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm run deploy`, or any npm scripts
- Never execute bash commands for building or deployment
- At checkpoints, prompt user to manually build, deploy, test, and commit
- Focus on file creation and code implementation only

**ðŸš€ Checkpoint Process:**
Each checkpoint will prompt: "Please manually run: `npm run build && npm run deploy` to test this checkpoint, then commit your changes before proceeding to the next task."
